## üìù Design Decisions

- **Product pages**  
  I decided not to create individual product pages due to the lack of information for each of them. I felt it was more usable without the added clutter.
- **Themes**
  I wanted to give the user some customisability, so I implemented a theme toggle switch!
- **Retro**
  Inspired by some of the older looking Apple PCs, I designed my site with a retro feel in mind.
- **README**
  This very file was built to be streamlined and attractive!

## ü§î What would I change?

- Database integration with more products
- Abillity to navigate to individual products with search bar
- Updated design to look more current in places
